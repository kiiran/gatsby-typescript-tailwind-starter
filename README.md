  Gatsby blog starter with Typescript + Tailwind
</h1>

This starter is a clone of the [Gatsby blog starter](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog), but with the following set up:

- ✅ TypeScript and ESLint
- 🏭 GraphQL code generation
- 💅 Tailwind, with dark mode and [Tailwind Typography](https://tailwindcss-typography.netlify.app/)

[💡 See the demo](https://typescripttailwindstarter.gatsbyjs.io/)

---

## 🚀 Quick start

1.  **Create a Gatsby site.**

    Use the Gatsby CLI to create a new site, specifying this blog starter as the template.

    ```shell
    gatsby new my-blog-starter https://github.com/kiiran/gatsby-typescript-tailwind-starter
    ```

1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new site’s directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    cd my-blog-starter/
    npm run dev
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

    Open the `my-blog-starter` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.tsx`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!
